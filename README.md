## fdaPDE Library

fdaPDE implements a class of spatial regression models in between statistics and numerical analysis. These models are particularly well-suited for situations where a prior knowledge of the underlying phenomenon is known and can be described in terms of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE).

## Installation

For the installation details see the file INSTALL.

## Examples

Some example can be found visualizing the help of the three main smoothing functions i.e.
`?smooth.FEM.basis` or `?smooth.FEM.PDE.basis` or `?smooth.FEM.PDE.SV.basis`
