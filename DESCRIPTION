Description: An implementation of regression models with partial differential
    regularizations, making use of the Finite Element Method. The models efficiently
    handle data distributed over irregularly shaped domains and can comply with
    various conditions at the boundaries of the domain. A priori information about
    the spatial structure of the phenomenon under study can be incorporated in the
    model via the differential regularization.
