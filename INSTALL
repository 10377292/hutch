R DEPENDENCIES

This package depends on the following R packages, which should be installed
before the installation of fdaPDE2:
- stats
- rgl
- grDevices
- graphics
- Rmpi
- RcppEigen
To check if these packages are installed it is useful to invoke the function
library() from an R session. If they are not, they can be installed with the 
function install.packages() from within an R session or with the command
R CMD INSTALL from the shell.

LIBRARIES

This package uses the library MUMPS. If the MUMPS library is not installed in
one of the directories of the standard path, the following variables should be
set in the file "src/Makefile.inc":

MUMPS_I=-I<path/to/MUMPS/include>
MUMPS_L=-L<path/to/MUMPS/lib>

INSTALLATION

1) Install the package with the command 'R CMD INSTALL'
   (type 'R CMD INSTALL -h' to see the available options. In particular the '-l'
   option allows to specify where to install the package).
2) In order for R to find the installed package it can be useful to create the 
   file ".Renviron" in the home directory and to add the line
        R_LIBS_USER=<path>
   where <path> is the directory where the package is installed.
